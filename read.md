This is  reworked, expanded version of my monthly expense tracker.
This one actually uses some data tools.
Forgive the embarrassing code, I am still just learining.

I finally fixed the import issue.
Here's a new roadmap of the things I need to do:


Phase 1: Core Functionality

    Initialize CSV with Header and Month 0 Data
        Modify create_csv to write header (âœ… in session 1)
        Add "Month 0" row with initial savings data when creating new file
        Ensure existing files aren't overwritten when adding header

    Monthly Data Collection
        Implement function to collect monthly income/expense data
        Calculate monthly savings: previous savings + income - expenses
        Validate inputs (non-negative numbers)

    CSV Appending System
        Create function to append new monthly data to CSV
        Automatically increment month number based on existing data
        Handle first month after initial savings (Month 1)


Phase 2: Time Management

    Date-Based Tracking
        Implement actual month/year tracking instead of incrementing numbers
        Use datetime to auto-detect current month/year
        Allow manual date entry for past months

    Multi-Year File Management
        Auto-create new CSV files when year changes
        Carry over final savings from previous year
        Implement year selection menu


Phase 3: Data Analysis

    CSV Reading & Basic Stats

        Implement pandas CSV reading
        Calculate: total income, total expenses, net savings change
        Show monthly averages

    Data Visualization

        Create savings trend line graph
        Generate income vs expense bar charts
        Add monthly comparison visuals


Phase 4: Advanced Features

    Data Editing & Error Correction

        Implement entry modification system
        Add data validation checks
        Create backup system before edits

    Reporting & Export

        Generate monthly summary reports
        Add PDF export functionality
        Implement data export to Excel

    Budgeting Features

        Add monthly budget goals
        Implement expense categorization
        Create budget vs actual comparisons


Phase 5: Polish & Deployment

    User Experience Improvements

        Create menu interface
        Add help documentation
        Implement progress indicators

    Error Handling & Validation

        Comprehensive input validation
        File permission handling
        Data corruption safeguards

    Installation & Distribution

        Create setup.py for installation
        Build executable version
        Add configuration management


Workflow:
1. Start with Phase 1 features in order (sessions 1-3)
2. Implement Phase 2 before Phase 3.
3. Complete Core Functionality before adding Analysis features
4. Save Advanced Features for last
5. Always implement error handling alongside new features
