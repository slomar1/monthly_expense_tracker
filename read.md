This is  reworked, expanded version of my monthly expense tracker.
This one actually uses some data tools.
Forgive the embarrassing code, I am still just learining.

I finally fixed the import issue.
Here's a new roadmap of the things I need to do:


Phase 1: Core Functionality (✅)

    Initialize CSV with Header and Month 0 Data
        Modify create_csv to write header (✅ in session 1)
        Add "Month 0" row with initial savings data when creating new file (✅ in session 2)

    Monthly Data Collection
        Implement function to collect monthly income/expense data (✅ in session 2)
        Calculate monthly savings: previous savings + income - expenses (✅ in session 2)

    CSV Appending System
        Create function to append new monthly data to CSV (✅ in session 2)
        Automatically increment month number based on existing data (✅ in session 2)
        Handle first month after initial savings (Month 1) (✅ in session 2)
        Add text to guide the user (✅ in session 2)


Phase 2: Time Management

    Date-Based Tracking
        Implement actual month/year tracking
        Allow manual date entry for month and year

    Multi-Year File Management
        Auto-create new CSV files when year changes
        Carry over final savings from previous year


Phase 3: Data Analysis

    CSV Reading & Basic Stats

        Implement pandas CSV reading
        Add ability fo add from last month instead of restarting with new file
        Calculate: total income, total expenses, net savings change
        Show monthly averages

    Data Visualization

        Create savings trend line graph
        Generate income vs expense bar charts
        Add monthly comparison visuals


Phase 4: Advanced Features

    Data Editing & Error Correction

        Implement entry modification system
        Add data validation checks
        Create backup system before edits

    Reporting & Export

        Generate monthly summary reports
        Add PDF export functionality
        Implement data export to Excel

    Budgeting Features

        Add monthly budget goals
        Implement expense categorization
        Create budget vs actual comparisons


Phase 5: Polish & Deployment

    User Experience Improvements

        Create menu interface
        Add help documentation
        Implement progress indicators

    Error Handling & Validation

        Comprehensive input validation
        File permission handling
        Data corruption safeguards

    Installation & Distribution

        Create setup.py for installation
        Build executable version
        Add configuration management


Workflow:
1. Start with Phase 1 features in order (sessions 1-3)
2. Implement Phase 2 before Phase 3.
3. Complete Core Functionality before adding Analysis features
4. Save Advanced Features for last
5. Always implement error handling alongside new features
