This is  reworked, expanded version of my monthly expense tracker.
This one actually uses some data tools.
Forgive the embarrassing code, I am still just learining.

I keep getting the same fucking import issue and I cannot fucking fix it.
I have tried everything and it still doesn't fucking work.
Might have to fuck around and abandon this project for this reason.
